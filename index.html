            <h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
            <p>25 years ago your father climbed the mountain and never came back. Now he’s calling for you with updated graphics, smoother interactions, and quality of life upgrades in the Director’s Cut of Broken Spectre.</p>
            <p>A winner of 6 awards and 11 other nominations and selections, Broken Spectre is an eldritch horror narrative game developed in collaboration with Michael Monello and Nick Braccia, makers of The Blair Witch Project.</p>
            <p>Searching for her long-lost father, Casey hears news that he may still be alive in the treacherous wilderness of Northwest Canada. She heads to Coldblood Mountain where she discovers evidence of her father's research.</p>
            <p>With severe weather conditions closing in and evil lurking around her, the journey soon turns from investigation to a desperate attempt to escape. Will she survive to find the truth? Only the tale will tell.</p>
            <p>Searching for him, you find his mutation experiments and a trail of breadcrumbs leading you up the slope. As night falls you spot someone on a ledge above you, but when you climb up it’s not your father - it’s an abomination.</p>
            <p>Trapped in the mountain’s maze, you find notes from a deranged ancient explorer offering salvation if you perform a grotesque ritual. The mountain bursts open and you’re transported into childhood memories giving you clues to press forward.</p>
            <p>At the summit you connect the terrible truth: each of your ancestors must climb this mountain to sacrifice themselves. Something unimaginable deep in the mountain has created this inevitable path for you. The final step is to reunite with your father atop a frozen ladder of corpses into the sky.</p>
            <p>Broken Spectre is a cosmic horror narrative experience centered around Casey's search for her missing father in the treacherous mountains of western Canada. Pushing the boundaries of VR immersion, players will be freed from traditional controllers and use Broken Spectre’s innovative development on hand-tracking to play through the game. A defined set of hand gestures will enable the player to explore the mountain, interact with objects, and climb terrain to unravel the story.</p>

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Broken Spectre is a cosmic horror narrative game for hand-tracking VR. You play as Casey, a strong-headed adventurer haunted by her troubled family history. You hear news that your father, a biologist long suspected dead in the treacherous wilderness of Northwest Canada, may still be alive.</p>
            <p>Searching for him, you find his mutated experiments and track his path, leading you to higher and more dangerous elevations. As night falls, you spot someone on a cliff ledge above you, with bated breath you climb up, but it’s not your father - it’s an unearthly abomination. Trapped in the mountain’s maze, you wonder, is time distorting your reality, or are you going mad with altitude sickness? Collect gruesome clues, decipher cryptic puzzles, perform cult rituals, and travel into family traumas in this mystical slow-burn horror story.</p>
